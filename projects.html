            <h2>Project 1: Graph Alignment using GNN</h2>
            <p>Developed a sophisticated Graph Alignment model utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to accurately align nodes across disparate graph-based datasets. Used node2vec for robust feature extraction and designed a Siamese Network architecture for optimized comparison of node embeddings.</p>

            <h2>Project 2: Estore</h2>
            <p>Developed a fully functional online store using Java RMI to create a distributed application framework. Applied multiple design patterns (MVC, Front Controller, Factory/Abstract Factory) and implemented features such as login, registration, browsing, adding, updating, removing, and purchasing items.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Anime Recommendation System</h2>
            <p>Conducted preliminary data exploration and performed essential data cleaning. Utilized kernel K-means clustering to categorize anime into 500 groups based on their average rating and genre. Implemented Singular Value Decomposition to suggest the top 5 anime tailored to each user.</p>
