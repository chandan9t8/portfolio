## Projects
### Graph Alignment using GNN
- Developed a sophisticated Graph Alignment model utilising **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to accurately align nodes across disparate
graph-based datasets.
- Employed node2vec for robust feature extraction, generating high-dimensional embeddings(64 dimensions) that capture the complex
relationships and similarities between nodes.
- Designed and implemented a Siamese Network architecture within the GNN framework to optimise the comparison of node embeddings,
significantly improving the model's accuracy in mapping node similarities.

### Estore
- Developed a fully functional online store using **Java RMI**, to create a distributed application framework.
- Applied multiple design patterns(MVC, Front Controller, Factory/Abstract Factory pattern) to enhance modularity and maintainability
- Implemented features such as login, registration for user and admin, browsing, adding, updating, removing, and purchasing items.
- Integrated a comprehensive login and authorization process to distinguish roles between customers and administrators, ensuring secure access to system functionalities.

### Anime Recommendation System
- Conducted preliminary data exploration and performed essential data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis.
- Utilised kernel K-means clustering to categorize anime into 500 groups based on their average rating and genre.
- Implemented Singular Value Decomposition to suggest the top 5 anime tailored to each user.

### Mini Projects in Data Mining
- Implemented the EM clustering algorithm on the Iris dataset, achieving optimal purity score of 90.6%.
- Implemented PCA on a toy dataset, reducing dimensionality and capturing the most significant features while retaining 95% of the variance.
- Implemented two variants of Matrix Factorization (MF) : gradient descent based approach and Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for latent representation of users and items in dyadic data.
