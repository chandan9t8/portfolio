## Projects
### Graph Alignment using GNN
Developed a sophisticated Graph Alignment model using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to accurately align nodes across different graph-based datasets. Node2vec was employed for robust feature extraction, generating high-dimensional embeddings (64 dimensions) that effectively capture the complex relationships and similarities between nodes. Additionally, a Siamese Network architecture was designed and implemented within the GNN framework to optimize the comparison of node embeddings, significantly improving the accuracy of mapping node similarities.

### Estore
A fully functional online store was developed using Java RMI to create a distributed application framework. Multiple design patterns (MVC, Front Controller, Factory/Abstract Factory pattern) were applied to enhance modularity and maintainability. Features such as login and registration for users and admins, browsing, adding, updating, removing, and purchasing items were implemented. Additionally, a comprehensive login and authorization process was integrated to distinguish roles between customers and administrators, ensuring secure access to system functionalities.

### Anime Recommendation System
Preliminary data exploration and essential data cleaning tasks were conducted to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis. Kernel K-means clustering was utilized to categorize anime into 500 groups based on their average rating and genre. Singular Value Decomposition was implemented to suggest the top 5 anime tailored to each user.

### Mini Projects in Data Mining
- Implemented the EM clustering algorithm on the Iris dataset, achieving optimal purity score of 90.6%.
- Implemented PCA on a toy dataset, reducing dimensionality and capturing the most significant features while retaining 95% of the variance.
- Implemented two variants of Matrix Factorization (MF) : gradient descent based approach and Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for latent representation of users and items in dyadic data.
